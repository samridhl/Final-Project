# Final-Project
Description: 
Differential gene expression in Mouse embryonic cap staged tooth germs With /without 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). ( Control and sample respectively).

Dataset: 
I am using GEO database from NCBI. This data is expression profiling by microâ€“array analysis. 
 The data is available in the form of Txt file. However, I am planning to use GEOquery library in the bio-conductor package that takes care of finding the file and unzip it. 
Link to the data:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE4873 


Proposed analysis:
Planning to make heat-map or volcano plot in r to show expression of the genes.
Libraries:
ggplot,
GEOquery: to get the dataset in the R,
Bioconductor Package 


Proposed Timeline & Major milestones (or segments):
Successfully loading the data into R-studio as data-frame.


User Interface:
Heat-map combined with the clustering to show which genes are up regulated and which genes are down regulated.
